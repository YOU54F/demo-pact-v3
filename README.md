# huehnerlady-pact-demo


this is a demo project to show the problem with the V3 version of datetime when updating the pct version from `4.1.34` to `4.6.3`

I moved all the files from consumer and provider over and anonymised them, so far the LocalDateTime still has some problem I need to figues out.
